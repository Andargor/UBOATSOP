{"name":"UBOAT SOP: Highest Crew Priority Wins","version":"2024.1.12.36","description":"[h1]UBOAT Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)[/h1]\r\n[h3]Highest Crew Priority Wins[/h3]\r\n\r\nPart of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3322088593]UBOAT Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)[/url] collection.\r\n\r\nThis mod will assign a task to the awake officer with the highest overall priority, when the boat is not alarmed. For example, you set a navigation table priority of 9 for the navigator and 8 for the skipper. The skipper is doing navigation and the navigator is sleeping. When the navigator wakes up, he will take over navigation and the skipper will move on to his next task.\r\n\r\nYou can therefore use this mod to fine tune priorities and assign certain tasks to certain officers, due to skills or other reasons.\r\n\r\nNOTES: The game sometimes adjusts priorities on the fly, so sometimes might not work, wait a sleep cycle. Also, officers with direct orders will stay at their post regardless of priorities. Finally, it can take 5 seconds or so for changes to occur.\r\n\r\nDoes not require a new game. May disable achievements (I don't really know)","author":"Andargor","supportedGameVersions":[ "2024.1 (Full Release)\nPatch 12" ],"assemblyName": "UBOATSOP_CrewPriorities","permissions":[],"steamFileId": 3321580385}
