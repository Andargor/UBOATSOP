{"name":"UBOAT SOP: Highest Crew Priority Wins","version":"2024.1.14.40","description":"[h1]UBOAT Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)[/h1]\r\n[h3]Highest Crew Priority Wins[/h3]\r\n\r\nPart of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3322088593]UBOAT Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)[/url] collection.\r\n\r\nThis mod will assign a task to the awake officer with the highest overall priority, when the boat is not alarmed. For example, you set a navigation table priority of 9 for the navigator and 8 for the skipper. The skipper is doing navigation and the navigator is sleeping. When the navigator wakes up, he will take over navigation and the skipper will move on to his next task.\r\n\r\nYou can therefore use this mod to fine tune priorities and assign certain tasks to certain officers, due to skills or other reasons.\r\n\r\nNOTES: The game sometimes adjusts priorities on the fly, so sometimes might not work, wait a sleep cycle. Also, officers with direct orders will stay at their post regardless of priorities. Finally, it can take 5 seconds or so for changes to occur.\r\n\r\nDoes not require a new game. May disable achievements (I don't really know)\r\n\r\n[h3]Known Issues[/h3]\r\n\r\nThe game automatically adjusts radio officer priorities on the fly, which prevents the mod from working at periscope depth to switch them around. You can try setting two radio officers with priority 9 hydrophone and priority 2 radio, and the second vice versa. If there is nothing else for them to do at priorities 3-8, they should switch when they are both not sleeping.\r\n\r\n[h3]Debugging[/h3]\r\n\r\nBefore reporting a bug, please make sure of the following:\r\n\r\n[*] The mod is enabled\r\n[*] You have read the conditions under which the mod will work\r\n[*] You have checked that no other mods may be interfering\r\n[*] You have checked in the file %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Deep Water Studio\\UBOAT\\output_log.txt that there is a line that reads 'UBOATSOP_CrewPriorities Version 2024.1.14.40'[/list]\r\n\r\n[h3]Source Code[/h3]\r\n\r\nSource code is available on Github, here: https://github.com/Andargor/UBOATSOP\r\n\r\nNOTE: Any mods on github that have not been released in the Steam Workshop are WORKS IN PROGRESS and may break your game.
