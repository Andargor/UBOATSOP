{"name":"UBOAT SOP: Crash Dive on Aircraft","version":"2024.1.12.18","description":"[h1]UBOAT Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)[/h1]\r\n[h3]Crash Dive on Aircraft[/h3]\r\n\r\nPart of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3322088593]UBOAT Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)[/url] collection.\r\n\r\nThis mod will make the uboat crash dive under the following conditions:\r\n[list][*] An aircraft is spotted\r\n[*] The aircraft is not folded up (i.e. not on an aircraft carrier)\r\n[*] The boat is not docked\r\n[*] The boat is not submerged or going to submerge (e.g. periscope depth will not trigger crash dive)[/list]\r\n\r\nNOTE: Actual dive speed depends on crew specialization, number of crew on deck when the crash dive occurs that have to get inside, number of idle crew that run to the bow, and if an officer is manning the depth controls. I may try to automate the latter eventually, but it's not simple due to alarm timing.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes not require a new game. May disable achievements (I don't really know)","author":"Andargor","supportedGameVersions":[ "2024.1 (Full Release)\nPatch 12" ],"assemblyName": "UBOATSOP_AircraftCrashDive","permissions":[],"steamFileId": 3321260073}
